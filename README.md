# CustomerChurn
Customer churn analysis using Tableau.

**Project Overview**
This repository contains a Tableau dashboard and supporting files for analyzing customer churn. The goal of this project is to identify key factors contributing to customer churn and provide actionable insights to improve customer retention.

**Data**
The dataset includes customer information such as account length, age, average monthly data usage, contract type, customer service calls, and churn status.

**Dashboard**
The Tableau dashboard provides interactive visualizations to explore customer churn trends and patterns. Key visualizations include:
* Overview of the data
* Churn Analysis rate over time
* Customer segmentation based on churn risk , Relationship between customer demographics and churn
* Impact of contract type and customer service calls on churn

**Usage**
To use the dashboard:

Open the Customerchurn.twb file in Tableau Desktop.
Explore the different visualizations and filters to gain insights into customer churn.

**Key Findings**
* Churn rate is 26.9% which means out of 6687 customers, 1796 left the company.
* The length of the contract is key factor in churn prediction. Customers who have monthly contracts are more likely to switch to other providers. Churn rate seems to be higher for lower account length. (Inverse correlation)
* The main churn reason is "Competitor made better offer".
* Customers who do not have partners seem to churn way more than those who do.
* The payement method used for most churned customers is debit card.
